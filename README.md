## Installation

**Install the Plugin**

* Login into Wordpress as admin and go to the plugins screen and select the "Add New" submenu.
* Search for "SecSign" and click "Install Now" or click on "Upload" and select the downloaded zip archive.
* Activate the plugin in the "Installed Plugins" list.

**Add the Login Widget**

* You can add the SecSignID Login Widget to your site to allow the login on e.g. the side menu.
* Go to the "Appearance" screen and click the "Widgets" submenu.
* Drag and drop the "SecSign ID Login" widget to e.g. the "Main Sidebar"

**General Configuration**

* Go to the "Settings" screen and select the "SecSign ID Login" submenu.
* Change the service address which will be shown to the user in the smartphone app. This should match the URL the user will see, when he visits your site.

**Coworker Configuration**

* You can integrate the SecSign ID login on the wp-login.php page. This is on by default.
* Optionally, you can assign SecSign IDs to the Wordpress users of your coworkers (Admins, Editors, Authors and Contributors). The users can also assign a SecSign ID in their profile themselves.
* You can also deactivate the normal password based login for the users, so they can only login using the SecSign ID. It’s recommended that you deactivate the password login for all coworkers, so your site is secured against brute force attacks. You should only allow the password based login for your own admin account, in case you lose your phone, and of course for all coworkers who have no smartphone. These accounts should be secured using a very strong password.

**User Configuration**

* Optionally, you can assign SecSign IDs to the Wordpress users of your website users (Subscibers). The users can also assign a SecSign ID in their profile themselves.
* It’s also possible to activate and deactivate the password based login for your users.

**Fast Registration**

* When new users sign in with their SecSign ID on your WordPress site, you can allow them to create a new WordPress user or assign an existing one themselves. This saves you from adding them manually and assigning a SecSign ID to their account.
